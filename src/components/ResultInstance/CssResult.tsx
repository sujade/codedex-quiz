                elements, lists, tables, but you can also style them very well! Centering divs are going to be a distant
                issue once you figure everything out! Before you know it, you&#39;ll be animating elements too!
                You&#39;re laid back but you&#39;re also intense when it comes to a project. You like facing new
                challenges that forces you out of your flex-box. This is where you thrive!<br/>
