 ## About The Project

This personality test is the first one I've ever created. Therefore I had to face some challenges that I've never had to face before. Coming up with a quiz logic took some serious rubber-ducking and writing code to scrap. But eventually, I came up with something that works fully. I've implemented an accessibility function. Which I normally always do with my projects but this time it was a font toggle. That was a slight problem in the beginning since I couldn't get it to work into the layout.tsx. To achieve my means, I've created another component to carry this function and passed it into the Footer component.
