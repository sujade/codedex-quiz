<h1>Codédex Personality Quiz</h1>

<p>This project is made for Codédex's April Challenge.</p>

<br/>

<h2>Technologies:</h2>

<p>For this project I've mainly used React + TypeScript + NextJS. For styling, I've used Bootstrap CSS along with regular CSS to make it look good and feel good.</p>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>

<p>My biggest challenge was coming up with the whole quiz logic and making the audio work. For that, I had to dive deep and research a lot, since TypeScript did not want to compile for a long time.</p>

<h2>Experience Gained:</h2>

<p>I was able to create a whole quiz app that works well and looks good! This has been the biggest project I've made in terms of the size of the project file. The project boasts with 16 components for a small-scale project and was planned to be a single-page application. Along the way, I needed to give result screens their pages to make the results shareable. </p>
